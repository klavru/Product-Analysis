# Product-Analysis

This project focuses on analyzing user behavior on your website and understanding the dynamics of their interactions with the products offered. We'll be using the tc-da-1.turing_data_analytics.raw_events table to gain insights into user sessions and their impact on the purchase journey.

## Task

Our primary task is to identify the time it takes for a user to make a purchase on your website. Specifically, we want to determine the duration from a user's first arrival on the website to their first purchase on the same day. This analysis provides valuable insights into user engagement and the factors affecting purchase decisions.

## Insights from the Analysis

### Average Duration

The analysis yielded an important metric: it takes, on average, 81 minutes for users to transition from their initial website visit to making a purchase. This average duration serves as a valuable indicator of user engagement.

### Relationship Between Session Duration and Revenue

Our exploration of the connection between session duration and revenue uncovered distinct patterns:

**1. By Device**

- **Desktop Users**: These users have an average session duration of 85 minutes and contribute a significant 58% of the total revenue.
- **Mobile Users**: Mobile users have an average session duration of 77 minutes, contributing 41% of the total revenue.
- **Tablet Users**: Tablet users have an average session duration of 64 minutes but contribute only 2% of the total revenue.

Given that tablet users contribute only 2% of the total revenue, our recommendations will primarily focus on optimizing the experiences for desktop and mobile users.

The substantial gap between session duration and revenue for tablet users highlights a potential issue with the browsing experience on tablets, which warrants further investigation.

**2. By Time of the Day**

We analyzed user behavior based on the time of the day, with the day divided into four segments:

- **Afternoon (12:00 - 18:00)**: Users in this segment exhibit an average session time of 90 minutes and contribute 25% of the total revenue.
- **Evening (18:00 - 00:00)**: Evening users have an average session time of 142 minutes and contribute 25% of the total revenue.
- **Morning (06:00 - 12:00)**: Users in the morning segment have an average session time of 59 minutes, contributing 24% of the total revenue.
- **Night (00:00 - 06:00)**: Night users have an average session time of 33 minutes, contributing 26% of the total revenue.
  
Notably, night users spend significantly less time on the website before making a purchase, which is over four times less than evening users. Interestingly, the revenue generated remains consistent across all time segments.

## Recommendations

**1. Optimize for Mobile Users**

As mobile users contribute a substantial 41% of the total revenue, focus on optimizing the mobile user experience. Ensure that your website is responsive, fast, and user-friendly on mobile devices to encourage more conversions.

**2. Enhance the Desktop Experience**

Given that desktop users account for a significant 58% of the total revenue, invest in improving the desktop user experience. Consider features or promotions that are specifically tailored to desktop users to further boost revenue.

**3. Segment User Experiences**

Segment your user base into desktop, mobile, and tablet users and create customized experiences for each group. Tailor promotions, content, and product recommendations based on the preferences and behaviors of these user segments.

**4. Continuous Monitoring**

User behavior is subject to change over time. Maintain regular monitoring of these metrics to adapt your strategies to evolving trends. Staying informed about user preferences and adjusting your approach accordingly is essential for long-term success.

**5. Conduct A/B Testing**

To gain deeper insights into the impact of specific changes, consider conducting A/B tests. Experiment with different user experiences, offers, or product placements to determine their effect on user behavior and revenue.

**6. Explore Time-Based Strategies**

Given the variations in user behavior throughout the day, consider implementing time-based strategies. Tailor promotions, product recommendations, or content to match the preferences and behaviors of users during specific time segments.

This analysis lays the groundwork for understanding user behavior's impact on revenue and optimizing the customer experience. By implementing these recommendations and staying attuned to evolving trends, you can enhance the user experience and drive revenue growth.
